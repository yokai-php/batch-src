## :warning: BETA

This library is following [semver](https://semver.org/).
However before we reach the first stable version (`v1.0.0`), we may decide to introduce **API changes in minor versions**.
This is why you should stick to a `v0.[minor].*` requirement !


# Installation

```
composer require yokai/batch-symfony-pack
```


## Documentation

This package is a pack and has no source.

Bridge of [`doctrine/persistence`](https://github.com/doctrine/persistence) for [Batch](https://github.com/yokai-php/batch).


## :warning: BETA

This library is following [semver](https://semver.org/).
However before we reach the first stable version (`v1.0.0`), we may decide to introduce **API changes in minor versions**.
This is why you should stick to a `v0.[minor].*` requirement !


# Installation

```
composer require yokai/batch-doctrine-persistence
```


## Documentation

This package provides:

- an [item writer](docs/object-item-writer.md) that persists objects through object manager
- an [object registry](docs/object-registry.md) that remembers found objects identities
